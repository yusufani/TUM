Welcome to my Master's Journey!

Buckle up, because here you'll find everything you need to know about my academic journey - from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. And let me tell you, there have been some pretty low lows. But hey, that's all part of the journey, right?

Below, you'll find a list of some of the courses I've taken, along with links to the corresponding repos. And hey, if you have any notes or resources to share, I'm always happy to accept MRs. Let's make this a collaborative learning experience, shall we?
